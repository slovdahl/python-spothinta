## About

A Python package with which you can retrieve the energy market prices from [spot-hinta.fi][spothinta].

Based on the [easyEnergy][easyenergy] library by [@klaasnicolaas][klaasnicolaas].

## Installation

```bash
pip install spothinta-api
```

## Data

This client currently supports getting today's and tomorrow's  hourly energy prices. The prices for tomorrow are usually published between 14:00 and 15:00. See [spot-hinta.fi API documentation][spothinta-api-docs] for more information about the available data.

## Example

```python
import asyncio

from datetime import date
from spothinta import SpotHinta


async def main() -> None:
    """Show example on fetching the energy prices from spot-hinta.fi."""
    async with SpotHinta() as client:
        energy = await client.energy_prices()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Setting up development environment

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager.

You need at least:

- Python 3.9+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages, to enter or exit the venv run the following commands:

```bash
poetry shell
exit
```

Setup the pre-commit check, you must run this inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

*Now you're all set to get started!*

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
